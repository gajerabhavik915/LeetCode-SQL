# step 1 -> I will creat the table with window function ( dense_rank()) and also do left join.
# note - (I will give partition by department so it will count both department sepertly)
# step 2 -> then I will only fetch those rows which have top three unique salary 

with t1 as 
    (select dept.name as Department, emp.name as Employee, emp.salary,
    dense_rank() over(partition by dept.name order by emp.salary desc) as 'rank'
    from employee as emp 
    left join Department as dept on emp.departmentid = dept.id)
    
select t1.Department, t1.Employee, t1.salary from t1
where t1.rank <= 3
